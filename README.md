## :hammer: Proposed Gadgets

* List all programs installed along with version numbers
* Snapshot configurations periodically, report changes, and store output in a file
* Check version compatability across programs
* Set configuration standards
* Logging VM configuration changes with a rich detail mode (users, memory spaces, processes, etc.)
* Alerting

If there is anything else you would like us to consider, please send us a message or open an issue!
